- Add support for login and storing oauth credentials in localStorage.
- Also need shorter titles.
- Consider adding source subfolders. E.g. use domain to create nytimes.com
  subfolder and put articles saved from that domain to that subfolder.
- What about other file types? pdfs?
- Scrape just the content?
- Should the extension be inside the omnibar instead of the side? (i.e. a
  page_action instead of a browser_action)
- Make it work for NYT multiple-page articles. Don't just want the first page.
